He called my name and the only reason I know it was mine is because I was next in line.

  <div class="span10 offset1">
    <h4>Of course, the reality is that getting all the names right can be very difficult.  With large and diverse student populations, many with uncommon, difficult, or even deceptively simple names, <strong> preventing such disappointment has traditionally been a painstaking task: </strong></h4>

        <h4>An announcer sums up:</h4>
        <br/>
        <blockquote><em>...the puzzles occupy my time in the run-up to commencement. Is the surname "Couture," as in "haute couture," or as in "Koo-cher"? "Edel-stine," or "-steen"? Is a student's first name "Tar-a" or "Tear-a"? And so on.<br/>
        <br/><strong>Often it's a matter of identity.</strong> One of our finest and best-known students surprised me with the revelation that she had stoically endured the mispronunciation of her name through four honor-filled years. Yet, because her French-Canadian roots were so meaningful to her, <strong>she appreciated being asked about her name so that her identity might be properly expressed as she walked across the platform.</strong><br/>
        <br/><strong>That example could be multiplied many times.</strong> So I e-mail students and faculty, request voicemails, check with advisers, corner folks in the dining hall. I make phonetic notes on alphabetical lists of possible attendees and transpose them to the "walker" cards that students hand me before crossing the stage. <strong>Technology? Using it will have to await a future year. Right now the task is to try and get it right for the moment.</strong><br/>
        <br/><strong>No doubt, many of you who are reading this take similar pains.</strong> The reason is not because it matters in some ultimate existential or intellectual sense, or because it is part of our job descriptions. We do so, rather, because <strong>what matters is to model painstaking preparation and hard work to our students and to make the academic ritual special for them and their families.</strong>
