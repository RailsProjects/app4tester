      <h3><i class="icon-check"></i>&nbsp;Honoring the Importance of the Name and the Moment</h3>
      <br/>
      <p>The commencement ceremony honors the graduate in front of family and friends, recognizing a major life milestone. The climax is the moment their name is announced, and they begin striding across the stage, family applauding or proudly looking on.<p> <p><strong>Each graduate's brief span of public recognition is priceless.</strong></p>   
      <p>But all too often, and despite best efforts, <strong>the once-in-a-lifetime moment is marred with the mispronunciation of their name</strong> - a kind of unintentional lack of personal recognition that can alienate and disappoint.  After all, it's their name, and their family's name, that identifies this moment as a celebration of <em>their</em> invidividual achievement.</p>

        <h4>From the perspective of a graduate:</h4>
        <blockquote><em>I still remember my high school graduation and how my vice principal butchered my name. He had no excuse, especially since he had the phonetic spelling written on a notecard AND we practiced the day before. He called my name and the only reason I know it was mine is because I was next in line. I might have looked around momentarily for the person who he just called.

    <p>Of course, it goes without saying that <strong>it can be very difficult to get all the names right.</strong> With large and diverse student populations, many with uncommon, difficult, or even deceptively simple names, <strong> preventing such disappointment has traditionally been a painstaking task... </strong>

        <h4>From the perpsective of an announcer:</h4>
        <blockquote><em>...the puzzles occupy my time in the run-up to commencement. Is the surname "Couture," as in "haute couture," or as in "Koo-cher"? "Edel-stine," or "-steen"? Is a student's first name "Tar-a" or "Tear-a"? And so on.<br/>
        <br/><strong>Often it's a matter of identity.</strong> One of our finest and best-known students surprised me with the revelation that she had stoically endured the mispronunciation of her name through four honor-filled years. Yet, because her French-Canadian roots were so meaningful to her, <strong>she appreciated being asked about her name so that her identity might be properly expressed as she walked across the platform.</strong><br/>
        <br/><strong>That example could be multiplied many times.</strong> So I e-mail students and faculty, request voicemails, check with advisers, corner folks in the dining hall. I make phonetic notes on alphabetical lists of possible attendees and transpose them to the "walker" cards that students hand me before crossing the stage. <strong>Technology? Using it will have to await a future year. Right now the task is to try and get it right for the moment.</strong><br/>
        <br/>No doubt, many of you who are reading this take similar pains. The reason is not because it matters in some ultimate existential or intellectual sense, or because it is part of our job descriptions. <strong>We do so, rather, because what matters is to model painstaking preparation and hard work to our students and to make the academic ritual special for them and their families.</strong>
