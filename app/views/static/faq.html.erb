                      <p>Similar services charge up to $300 per graduation ceremony.  While many institutions are willing to budget those line-items for important events, we don't think that's reasonable, and we keep costs low by adhering to the philosophy that simpler works better here. </p>

                       <p>For example, we don't use text-to-voice or voice-to-text algorithms - the entire point of getting the name right is to directly hear, and reproduce, how the individual says their name, without the mediation of a synthesized voice that will inevitably not faithfully reproduce all pronunciations anyway! </p>

                       <p>Instead, we use ubiquitously-recognized and fully web-based audio-recording and playback technology (rather than a more complicated telecom system). So once more, simple = most cost-effective and high-fidelity. </p>

                       <p>Similarly, allowing the announcers to enter their own phonetic spellings/notes, if they desire, allows them to reproduce and recall the recorded pronunciations in whatever way is easiest for them. </p>

                       <p>In sum, our unique solution to the pronuncation problem is at once the most user-friendly, cost-effective, and hi-fidelity!</p>
