      <h3><em>NameCoach</em> customers purchase Event Pages, either by-the-event or through a monthly subscription.  An event's Event Page allows the person publicly announcing names at that event - say, a wedding, bar-mitzvah, or corporate function - to quickly and easily learn to pronounce them. </h3>

      <p>Just enter a name (like 'The Jones-Ravenwood Wedding'), and a date for the event.
      You can also choose an event code, which is one way to invite attendees to record their names.</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-envelope"></i>&nbsp;Invite Other Admins&nbsp;<span class="muted">(optional)</span></h3>
      <p>Once you create an Event Page, you automatically become an 'admin' for that event. Admins can invite attendees to record their names, listen to those recordings, and invite others to become admins.  This is useful if, say, you want the brother of the groom to invite the attendees to record their names, and want the DJ to be able to practice the names.</p>

      <p>To invite an admin, you have two options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Just enter an email address to send an admin invitation via email.  When they click a link in this email and sign up, they will automatically become an admin for your event.</li> <br/>
          <li> Or, you can give them the admin code generated for you.  They can then visit name-coach.com and use the code to sign up as an admin for your event.</li>
