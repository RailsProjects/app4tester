An event page allows the person publicly announcing names at a given event - say, a wedding, bar-mitzvah, or corporate function - to quickly and easily learn to pronounce the names for that event. </h3>

      <p>Just enter a name (like 'The Jones-Ravenwood Wedding'), and a date for the event.
      You can also create an event code, which can be used as an alternative way to invite attendees to record their names.</p>

      <h3><i class="icon-envelope"></i>&nbsp;Invite Other Admins&nbsp;<span class="muted">(optional)</span></h3>
      <p>Once you create an event page, you automatically become an 'admin' for that page. Admins can invite attendees to record their names, listen to those recordings, and invite others to become admins.  This is useful if, say, you want the brother of the groom to invite the attendees to record their names, and want the DJ to be able to practice the names.</p>

      <p>To invite an admin, you have two options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Just enter an email address to generate an admin invitation email.  When they click the link in the email and sign up, they will automatically become an admin for your event.</li> <br/>
          <li> Or, you can give them the admin code generated for you.  They can then visit name-coach.com and use the code to sign up as an admin for your event.</li>

      <p>If the person practicing names wants a name re-recorded for any reason, they can click a button to email a request.  Admins can also send reminders to attendees to register and record their names with just a click (as long as the attendee was invited using an email address rather than an event code), and enter their own helpful notes.</p>
